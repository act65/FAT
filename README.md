# FAT
Fatrix - a functional matrix
An extension of numpy libraries with matrices to allow a functional type of matrix algebra. 
Can be used to build computational graphs 

    Traditional dot
    a, b  .  e,  f   =  a.e + b.g, a.f + b.h
    c, d     g,  h   =  c.e + d.g, c.f + d.h
    Fdot
    a, b  .  e,  f   =  a(e) + b(g), a(f) + b(h)
    c, d     g,  h   =  c(e) + d(g), c(f) + d(h)
    
The motivation being that when you look at the fatrixes of common neural network structures, like CNNs, RNNs, ResNets, â€¦ etc you start to see some interesting patterns in the structure of the fatrices. See [this](https://github.com/act65/FAT/blob/master/Modular%20nets.ipynb) for more details and motivation.
