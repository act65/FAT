Relationship between;
nilpotent duals, automatic differentiation, functional programming, sonnet, FAT, linear algebra.

Let $\mathcal F$ be the set of quads.
Define $f \in \mathcal F$ such that;

<side>but nabla is just a linear operator? how can we use this to make things work?</side>

$$
\exists f^{-1}: f^{-1} \circ f \approx f \circ f^{-1} \approx identity \\
\exists \nabla f:  \frac{\partial f}{\partial ?} \\
\exists \nabla f^{-1}:  \\
$$

<side>A kind of approximate algebra. Close enough...</side>

If we want do some algebra with these things we need a richer type system!
important types;

* maps to same dimensionality
* orthogonal transform
* linear transform
*


<!-- how could group theory come into this? symmetry, parameter sharing, ...? -->
